# Autonomous Drone Open Source Project

 I hope this project can bring unlimited wisdom and light to R&D in drones.

## Project Overview

This project is an open-source autonomous drone software platform that provides a comprehensive solution for intelligent and autonomous flight of drones. It is based on the PX4 open-source flight controller firmware and the ROS (Robot Operating System). The aim is to offer developers a mature and usable onboard computer software system, facilitating a more straightforward and rapid development experience. Currently, the project integrates modules such as control, planning, and target detection, and provides multiple functional demos along with simulation components.

## Quick Start

- **Installation and Usage:**
  - Requires a basic understanding of the C programming language (most programs are in C, with some modules containing a small amount of C++ and Python syntax).
  - Beginners are advised to first learn the ROS official tutorials.
  - While in-depth knowledge of PX4 flight control code isn't necessary, understanding basic concepts and operations is essential.

- **Q&A and Communication:**
  - Official forums and community groups are available for discussions and regular Q&A sessions.
  - Regular live broadcasts and training sessions are conducted to assist users.

## Advanced Learning

- **Autonomous Drone Development Course:**
  - This course focuses on the foundational knowledge and practical operations within this project, suitable for beginners. More advanced learning materials are currently being prepared.

## Hardware Products

- **Essential Simulation Remote Controller:**
  - Available for purchase to aid in simulation exercises.

- **Autonomous Drone Development Platform:**
  - Offers a complete platform with rich documentation, after-sales service, and technical guidance.
  - Complimentary access to offline engineering training courses and discounts on advanced development courses.

- **Supporting Hardware:**
  - Includes frames, onboard computers, stereo cameras, LiDARs, and other hardware essential for drone development.
